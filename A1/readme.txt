- Implemented two rocks/spheres in main.js line 284

(d) Seaweed modeling: each strand has 10 ellipses. (4 Marks)
- Seaweed modelling with 10 green ellipses implemented in main.js lines 269 and 566

(e) Seaweed animation (4 Marks).
- Seaweed animates and strands are identical in main.js lines 269 and 566

(f) Seaweed positioning (3 strands) (3 Marks).
- Seaweeds are positioned the same way as the sample video

(g) Fish modeling: 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body, 2 tail fins, (6 Marks).
- Fish model has 2 eyes with pupils, 1 head, 1 body and 2 tail fins that oscillate

(h) Fish animation: The fish must swim in a circle around the seaweed. It should
always be aligned with the tangent of the circle. (4 Marks).
- Fish swims around the seaweed and is tangent to the circle (main.js line 307)

(i) A burst of 4-5 bubbles should appear every few seconds. (4 Marks).
- 4-5 bubbles is randomly chosen and appear every 4 seconds in main.js line 422

(j) Each bubble should appear near the mouth of the character (2 Marks).
- main.js line 437 spawns the bubbles at the mouth of the diver

(k) The shape of each bubble should oscillate with time. (2 Marks).
- Bubble shape oscillates with time in main.js line 594

(l) Each bubble should move straight up with time. (2 Marks).
- Bubbles move up after spawning from divers mouth in main.js line 549

(m)Each bubble should be removed/deleted after approximately 12 seconds. (1
Mark).
- bubbles have a lifespan of 12 seconds are this logic is in main.js line 554

(n) Model a human character with no arms. (4 Marks).
- Diver modelled in main.js starting at line 405

(o) The character should move in the x and y world directions. (2 Marks).
- Moves in x and y direction in main.js line 408

(p) The legs of the character should kick (hips, knees) as shown in the video. (4
Marks). The feet do not move.
- Legs kick and feet do not move in main.js starting at line 468

(q) You do not have to match the exact motion or dimensions of the objects shown in
the sample executable. However, your scene and the sample one should be
visually similar (4 Marks).
- Scene and sample are visually similar

(r) Programming style (comments, functions) (2 Marks).
- Comments are used throughout the code and functions are made for repetitive tasks such as
drawing bubbles and seaweed

(s) The scene should be 512x512. [-2 Marks if it is not.]
- Canvas is set to 512x512

(t) You have to submit a SINGLE file called <firstname-lastname>.zip (-2
Marks if you do not) that includes all the necessary files, unless the TA posts
different submission instructions.
(u) You nave to include a readme.txt file that describes in full detail which of the
required elements you have implemented successfully and which ones you
have not. [-4 if you do not].
If the code does not run, or no objects appear in the window, or only the
template code is running properly, no partial marks will be given.
